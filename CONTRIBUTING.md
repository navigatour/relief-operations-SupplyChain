This is the very begining of this Social project to be developed by crowd development & crowd sourcing.

To achive this goal we expect that different activities are required to be done, starting from concepts design, architecture, coding, test, security, deployment, hosting, etc

We assume that there will be different kind of contributors that will join us in this journey:
1) Contributors for TIME:
   Those who would spend their precious time to help us develop this project by means of performing some of the tasks of the project;
2) Contributors of Money:
    Those who will contribute their money to develop this Project.
    We would highly encourage if you join hands with us and make small contributions.

[Note: Since the project is just starting and we have not set-up Donation account, probably you can contribute in form of making some "Vendor Payments" directly.]

Q. Why would there be need of Money?
    While we try to use the open source there will be certain cost that will be unavoidable e.g. hosting cost, AWS cost, license cost (if we plan to use any paid tools). 
    To speed-up the development we may choose to use the freelancers for certain time.
    
    At this time we the "Navigatour Team" plan to put in our money to kick start the development for the Project.
    
    We believe transparency is very important for the Social Projects, thus we will make every contribution made by anyone public using this Page. Not only we will publish the monetory contributions but also the contributions made in time.
